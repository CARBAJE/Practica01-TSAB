Medical image processing is key for diagnosis, where contrast enhancement is essential for the correct identification of structures. In this practice, a bio-inspired algorithm is implemented to optimize metrics such as standard deviation (STD) or entropy to improve visual quality without distorting the original information. Using techniques based on swarm intelligence and natural evolution, the method dynamically adjusts the contrast enhancement parameters. The results demonstrate better visual perception and greater discrimination of key anatomical structures, facilitating medical interpretation.
